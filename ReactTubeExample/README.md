# ReactTube

An ad free Youtube alternative developed in React-Native mainly for Apply TV, but should also work on other Android and iOS Platforms.

Main goals:

- Youtube-experience without **ADs**
- General Youtube client features

**Currently, still in development**, contributions welcome!

This project uses the [Youtube.js](https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js) library to access the Youtube API.
